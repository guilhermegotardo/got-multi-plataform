Subject: [PATCH 119/184] printk: Skip non-finalized records in panic

Normally a reader will stop once reaching a non-finalized
record. However, when a panic happens, writers from other CPUs
(or an interrupted context on the panic CPU) may have been
writing a record and were unable to finalize it. The panic CPU
will reserve/commit/finalize its panic records, but these will
be located after the non-finalized records. This results in
panic() not flushing the panic messages.

Extend _prb_read_valid() to skip over non-finalized records if
on the panic CPU.

Fixes: 896fbe20b4e2 ("printk: use the lockless ringbuffer")
